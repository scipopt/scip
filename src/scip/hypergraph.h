 * @brief  Internal methods for dealing with hypergraphs
 * @author Matthias Walter
 *
 * A <em>hypergraph</em> \f$ G \f$ is a pair \f$ (V,E) \f$ of <em>vertices</em> \f$ v \in V \f$ and
 * <em>(hyper-)edges</em> \f$ e \in E \f$ such that \f$ e \subseteq V \f$ holds. We say that a vertex \f$ v \f$ and an
 * edge \f$ e \f$ are <em>incident</em> if \f$ v \in e \f$ holds.
 * A subset \f$ U \subseteq V \f$ is called an <em>overlap set</em> if it is a nontrivial intersection of two distinct
 * edges, i.e., if \f$ U = e \cap f \f$ for \f$ e,f \in E \f$ and \f$ |U| \geq 2 \f$. In this case, we say that
 * \f$ U \f$ and \f$ e \f$ are <em>incident</em> (same for \f$ f \f$. We denote the set of overlap sets by
 * \f$ \mathcal{U} \f$.
 *
 * A \ref SCIP_HYPERGRAPH struct defines such a hypergraph \f$ G = (V,E) \f$, potentially with the set
 * \f$ \mathcal{U} \f$ of overlaps. Efficient access for retrieving elements is provided, e.g., the vertices incident
 * to an edge, the edges incident to a vertex, or the edges incident to an overlap.
