 * @brief  greedy deletion and addition filter heuristic to compute IISs
 * @author Marc Pfetsch
 * @author Mark Turner
 * @author Paul Meinhold
 *
 * An irreducible infeasible subsystem (IIS) is a subset of the constraints and bounds from a problem
 * that is infeasible.
 * The greedy filter heuristic has two different approaches for producing an (I)IS:
 * - Remove constraints such that the remaining problem is still infeasible.
 * - Add constraints from an empty problem until the problem becomes infeasible.
 * Both these approaches can be augmented to include bounds. That is, existing bounds can be deleted
 * while the IS remains infeasible. A common approach is to also apply the deletion based
 * filter after applying the additive based filter.
 * This greedy algorithm is based on
 *
 * O. Guieu and J. Chinneck, Analyzing infeasible mixed-integer and integer linear programs,@p
 * INFORMS J. Comput. 11, no. 1 (1999), pp. 63â€“77.
 *
 * If the appropriate parameters are set then we can guarantee that the result is irreducible, i.e.,
 * an irreducible infeasible subsystem (IIS). Otherwise we may only obtain an infeasible subsystem (IS).
 * This algorithm cannot guarantee to find the smallest possible IIS.
