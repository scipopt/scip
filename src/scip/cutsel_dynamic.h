 * @brief  dynamic cut selector
 * @author Christoph Graczyk
 *
 *  The dynamic cut selector is an extension of the hybrid cut selector to employ a dynamic range for the orthogonality
 *  filtering, dependent on the efficacy ratio between cuts. It allows the user to specify a minimum efficacy gain in
 *  percentage to filter cuts, which corresponds geometrically to the idealized shift from the LP solution adding only
 *  the first cut to the intersection with the second cut.
 *  In this way we can enforce a minimum orthogonality between cuts through the efficacy ratio. This should, in theory,
 *  avoid the selection of cutting plane pairs that do not improve the lp solution, but only increase the number of cuts
 *  in the lp.
 *
 *  The selector allows the user to specify a filtering strategy during cut selection ('d'ynamic- and 'f'ull dynamic),
 *  which determines how the orthogonality filtering is applied.
 *  In both cases, after a cut is selected, the remaining cuts are re-sorted by computing their relative efficacy to the
 *  selected cut. The efficacy ratio is then used to filter the cuts based on the filtering strategy:
 *  - 'd'ynamic-parallelism: The dynamic parallelism strategy filters cuts based on the efficacy ratio between cut
 *  pairs. It only filters cuts that are not theoretically improving the efficacy of the pair given the first cut, i.e.,
 *  the efficacy ratio is below the minimum efficacy gain in percentage, without calculating or resorting the cut array.
 *
 *  - 'f'ull dynamic parallelism: The full dynamic parallelism strategy filters cuts based on the efficacy ratio between
 *  cut pairs by iteratively recomputing the score given the previously selected cut. This results in a set of cuts
 *  that is a sequence of theoretically most effective almost orthogonal cuts, whereby almost orthogonal means that
 *  the efficacy ratio is above the minimum efficacy gain in percentage.
