This is an AMPL interface for SCIP.

Currently not supported, but planned for future versions:
 - setting user parameters in SCIP from AMPL (AMPL solver options)

Please let us know (e-mail to scip@zib.de mailing list), if you are missing any of these or any other features.
Please let us know if you find any bugs, unexpected behavior, or compatibility problems (report via http://scip.zib.de/#contact)

To use SCIP from AMPL, you have to do the following:
 - execute the ./get.ASL script to download the AMPL solver library sources;
   the script downloads the compressed tarball and expands it in a directory solvers
 - build the AMPL solver library,
   on Linux, this may be possible by doing "cd solvers; make -f makefile.u",
   on MinGW with MS or Intel compiler, this may be possible by doing "cd solvers; cp details.c0 details.c; nmake -f makefile.vc"
 - build SCIP (see ../../INSTALL)

When using the SCIP CMake system, either:
 - build target scipampl from the main build directory: e.g. make scipampl
or:
 - generate a new build directory in interfaces/ampl and configure the build accordingly:
    - mkdir build; cd build
    - cmake .. -DSCIP_DIR=<path/to/SCIP/build/dir>
    - make

When using the SCIP Makefile system:
 - build the SCIP-AMPL binary with the same OPT/LPS/ZIMPL/IPOPT/... flags as the SCIP binary in this directory, e.g.,
   make LPS=spx ZIMPL=false IPOPT=true  (ignore the compiler warnings...)
   If that does not work out of the box, it may be required to adapt the "ASL library" section in Makefile!
 - the latter should creates a link ./bin/scipampl that points to a binary that expects an AMPL .nl file as command line argument and,
   if given, attempts to read this instance into SCIP and tries to solve it
 - call make test (with the same flags for OPT/LPS/ZIMPL/IPOPT/... as before) to check if the binary is working

To get help on command line parameters, call the scipampl binary without arguments.

WARNINGS: The executable has only been tested on the command line when running with a .nl file, not within AMPL.
          We have tested only "simple" .nl files, fancy stuff like defined variables may not work.
