performance improvements:
- improved scaling of linear constraints, linear constraints with integral variables will now be scale with
  1e+06/MAX(maximal absolute coefficient, 1.0) instead of 1e+03/MAX(maximal absolute coefficient, 1.0);
  if all coefficients are in absolute value equal they will be scaled by that
- if probing reached the end of all variables it will restart the probing cycle correctly
- improved intdiving heuristic by activating backtracking to a different fixing value
- improved scaling by choosing the smallest scaler
- if first root lp is solved and the optimality is rejected by SCIP, there won't be an unnecessary solving of the lp
  from scratch again
- automatically turn off separation in sepa_oddcycle if it was too unsuccessful within the last calls
- use faster Dijkstra variants in sepa_oddcycle
- improved pseudo objective propagator
- streamlined initlp functions in cons_indicator, cons_sos1, cons_sos2 (add rows only if needed)
- added clique presolving for and-constraints, which checks if two operands or one operand and the resultant are in a
  clique and then fixes the resultant to 0 and in the former case we can delete the and-constraint too
- improved probing by ordering the variables differently and applying the one-branch before the zero-branch
- improved lp-, mps-, opb-reading time
- improved time used for adding implications
- improved tcliquegraphAddImplicsVars() in sepa_clique.c to faster add possible variables
- added parameters mincoveredrel and mincoveredabs to heur_undercover to only run if problem is sufficiently nonlinear
- heur_undercover treats indicator constraints as nonlinear and fixes the binary variable for linearization
- speed up in linear constraint handler replacing aggregated variables
- speed up in SCIPboolarrayExtend() in misc.c replacing a for loop with BMSmoveMemoryArray() call
- speed up mps reader asking parameters only once
- speed up in var.c changing some recursive calls into iterative calls and reducing the number of VARFIX event that are
  thrown for fixation, aggregation or multi-aggregations

  aggressive separation
- revised reduced cost propagator
- increased performance in SCIPcliqueAddVar(), adding a variable to a clique
- tighten primal and dual feasibility tolerances independently if they are not reached in LP solving
- when all nonlinearities have been fixed and the number of nonfixed variables is 1 in cons_nonlinear/cons_quadratic/
  cons_bivariate, handle it by a bound change instead of adding a linear constraint
- removed 'targetscip' parameter from SCIPconvertCutsToConss(), now this function can only convert cuts on one instance,
  otherwise use SCIPcopyCuts()
- added 'ncutsadded' parameter to SCIPcopyCuts() to be able to store the number of copied/converted cuts
- new method SCIPpermuteIntArray() in pub_misc.h and misc.c for permuting an integer array

plugins:
- added new presolver convertinttobin, which converts bounded integer variables to their binary representation, e.g.
  for integer variable 0 <= x <= 10 the binary variables y0, y1, y2, and y3 are created, such that
  1 y0 + 2 y1 + 4 y2 + 8 y3 <= 10 and x = 1 y0 + 2 y1 + 4 y2 + 8 y3
- added nlpdiving heuristic that comprises several diving heuristics using an NLP relaxation
- added new presolver gateextraction, which tries to find and-gates/constraints which are linearized
  e.g. (x + y + z >= 1, x + y <= 1 and x + z <= 1 => x == AND(~y,~z)), in special cases it also detects set-partitioning
  constraints e.g. (x + y + z >= 1, x + y <= 1, x + z <= 1 and y + z <= 1 => x + y + z == 1));
  gate-extractor is also able to detect logicor constraints and set-packing/-partitioning constraints with the same
  variables, to upgrade these both constraints to a set-partitioning constraint
- added reader for MI(NL)Ps in OSiL (Optimization Services Instance Language) format
- added new presolver components, that searches for independent components in the problem structure and solves
  these components as sub-SCIPs when they are small enough (per default <= 20 discrete variables, nodelimit of 10000)
- added new presolver domcol that looks for dominated columns in a MIP and tries to fix them
- added zeroobj heuristic that solves a copy of the problem without an objective function and with quite strict limits
  on the number of nodes and LP iterations
- complete reworking of the vbounds propagator: it now takes into account variable bounds, cliques, and implications,
  stores bounds of variables which were changed, and performs a forward propagation from these bounds, i.e., tries to
  derive new bounds for other variables; during propagation, bound changes are propagated in an (almost) topological order

- primal solutions with infinite objective value are now automatically discarded
- better handling of infinite solution values for aggregated and negated variables
- fixed bug that disabled multi-aggregation of two integer or implicit integer variables

- fixed bug in sepa_clique.c, could not handle only empty cliques, that were not removed
- all plugins that solve sub-SCIPs now do not stop the whole solution process if there has been an error

- fixed bug in cip reader, wrong use of SCIPstrtok()

- new parameter <presolving/convertinttobin/maxdomainsize> by default is set to SCIP_LONGINT_MAX, which deternmines
  the domainsize for which integers are converted to their binary representation

- added possible value 'd' for <constraints/soc/nlpform> to choose a convex division form for SOC constraint
  representation in NLP

  resolveiterfac is a factor by which the average number of iterations per call is multiplied to get the limit, but the
  limit is at least resolveitermin; default is -1 (no limit) for resolveiterfac and 1000 for resolveitermin
- added parameter <constraints/indicator/generatebilinear> to generate bilinear (quadratic) constraints instead of
  indicator constraints

  linearizations in every solution found by some heuristic
- renamed parameter <constraints/quadratic/mincutefficacyenfo> to <constraints/quadratic/mincutefficacyenfofac> and
  interpret it as a factor of the feasibility tolerance
- removed fastmip setting 2, which means the dualsolution would not be calculated but because SCIP always asks for the
  dual solution, the lp would be reoptimized to calculate them; so it had no real effect

  external branching candidates (e.g., in spatial branching for MINLP)

  if FALSE by buffering them; if <lp/freesolvalbuffers> is TRUE, we free the buffer memory each time (FALSE by default)
- added parameter <constraints/quadratic/checkfactorable> to disable check for factorable quadratic functions (xAx =
  (ax+b)*(cx+d)) in quadratic constraints and not to use of this information in separation (generates lifted tangent
  inequalities according to Belotti/Miller/Namazifar if also linear vars are present)
- added parameters <constraints/{nonlinear,quadratic,soc,abspower}/sepanlpmincont> to specify minimal required fraction
  of continuous variables in problem to enable linearization of convex constraints in NLP relaxation solution in root
- added parameter <conflict/separate> which enables or disables the separation of conflict constraints
- added parameter <lp/clearinitialprobinglp> to clear LP state at end of probing mode, if LP was initially unsolved

- changed computation of optimality gap which is now done in the same way as described in the MIPLIB 2010 paper: the gap
  is 0, if primalbound (pb) and dualbound (db) are equal (within tolerances), it is infinity if pb and db have opposite
  signs, and (this changed), if both have the same sign, the difference between pb and db is devided by the minimum of

- implement presolving in exitpre() in cons_orbitope and cons_indicator
- implement possibility to force a restart in cons_indicator if enough indicator variables have been fixed
- functionality to use the bound flipping ratio test of SoPlex is available (requires at least version 1.5.0.7)
- there exists now a solution candidate store for the original problem; during transformation these solutions are tried;
  during free the transformed problem the best feasible solution of the transformed problem are copied to the solution
  candidate store of the original problem; this useful if you solve several problems iteratively, solutions get now
  carried over automatically.
- solutions which are given by the user from the outside are now marked by '#' in the output
- implemented possibility to buffer and restore LP solution after diving without having to resolve the LP; currently
  turned off, because performance impact is unclear; controlled by parameters lp/resolverestore and lp/freesolvalbuffers
- reworked concept of lazy bounds: they can now also be used for problems where constraints and objective together
  ensure the bounds; to allow this also for diving heuristics that might change the objective and thus destroy this
  property, lazy bounds are explicitly put into the LP during diving and removed afterwards
- the varbound constraint handler can now parse its constraints
- added beta version of variable deletion: for branch-and-price application, variables can now be completely deleted
  from the problem; variables that are deletable have to be marked with SCIPvarMarkDeletable(), constraint handlers can
  implement the new SCIP_DECL_DELVARS callback that should remove variables from the constraints; at the moment, only
  the linear, the setppc, and the knapsack constraint handler support this callback; furthermore, when using this
  feature, all used plugins have to capture and release variables they store in their data, this is currently only done
  for the aforementioned constraint handlers as well as the and, the varbound, and the logicor constraint handler; for
  more details about this feature, see the FAQ

design:
- SCIP_HASHMAP now works also without block memory
- the probing presolver presol_probing.{c.h} is now a propagator prop_probing.{c,h}, all corresponding parameters moved
  as well
- the redcost separator sepa_redcost.{c.h} is now a propagator prop_redcost.{c,h}, all corresponding parameters moved as
  well
- moved all timings to type_timing.h
- outsourced propAndSolve() method in solve.c which calls domain propagation and solving of the lp and relaxation
- CIP format variable characters defined, e.g. SCIP_VARTYPE_INTEGER_CHAR
- add expression graph data structures and methods for reformulation, domain propagation, and simple convexity check on
  nonlinear expressions

statistic:
- the "Solving Time" is now spitted into presolving, solving, and reading time
- Presolvers section has new column "AddCons" which states the number of added constraint
- Constraints section has new column named "#ResProp" which show the number of resolve propagation calls of certain
  constraint handler
- Constraint Timing section has a new column "ResProp" which states the time spend in resolve propagation method of the
  constraint handler
- new section "Propagator Timing" which shows the time spend in different callbacks of the propagator
- rearranged first two columns of Propagators section; "#Propagate" and "#ResProp" stating the number of call for
  propagation and resolve propagation; the Time column is moved into the new section Propagator Timings
- Constraints section has new column named "MaxNumber" which the maximum number of active constraint of a certain
  constraint handler
- added two columns "Time-0-It" and Calls-0-It" in the LP section which states the number of LP call and time spend for
  solving LPs with zero iterations (only refactorization)

Makefile
- via "PARASCIP=true" as a "Makefile" option it is possible to compile SCIP threadsafe in DEBUG-mode, (in OPT-mode it's
  only necessary if non-default messagehandler or CppAD is used)
- new variable $(INSTALLDIR) in Makefile which define installation directory for the libraries, $(INSTALLDIR)/lib/,
  binary, $(INSTALLDIR)/bin, and include headers, $(INSTALLDIR)/include, the default value is the empty string
- new target in Makefile "install" performs "make" and copies using the install command the include headers, binary, and
  libraries
- new target in Makefile "uninstall" removes libraries, binary, and include headers form INSTALLDIR
- the 'make' parameter 'PARASCIP=true' leads to threadsafe message handlers where you need to call
  SCIPcreateMesshdlrPThreads and SCIPmessageSetHandler/SCIPmessageSetDefaultHandler and SCIPfreeMesshdlrPThreads;
  therefor we need to link with pthread library
- to link against IPOPT, only the base directory of an Ipopt installation need to be specified now; additionally, if
  building with gnu compilers, the Ipopt libraries directory is stored in the SCIP binary, which should make it easier
  to run with Ipopt shared libraries
- new target "make libs" which compiles only the libraries
- to link against Clp, only the base directory of an Clp installation needs to be specified now
- moved *.test and *.solu files to subdirectory testset in check directory and adjusted test scripts
- adjusted all test scripts to use the same new optimality gap computation as in SCIP
- added Makefile option "VALGRIND=true" to enable running the SCIP checks (make test) through valgrind; valgrind errors
  and memory leaks are reported as fails
- removed target "lintfiles", this target is now imitated by the "lint" target and a none empty variable FILES

==================

interface:
- allow access to transformed constraints in SCIP_STAGE_TRANSFORMED

  presolving
- fixed performance issue in presolving w.r.t. to computing the number of new fixings, aggregated, and so on before a

  generation applications
- fixed some bugs w.r.t. to casting pointer arrays

features:
- constraint handler can now register their upgrade functions for quadratic constraints to cons_quadratic (similar to
  LINCONSUPGD)
- added branchcands for relaxator solution, that can be added by the relaxator and used by branching rules
- added relaxsol to variables, s.t. a relaxator can store a solution on which branching or separation can be done
- added relaxation structure to SCIP, it represents global relaxation information independent from a specific relaxator;
  at the moment, it contains information about the relaxation solution stored in the variables: objective value and
  validness
- SCIP can now branch on relaxation solutions that are either installed to the relaxsol field of the variables or added
  to the list of relaxation candidates, e.g., by constraint handlers. Branching on relaxation solutions is performed if
  the enforcement resulted in an unresolved infeasibility and there are no LP branching candidates, but before pseudo
  solution branching.  The branching rules leastinf, mostinf, random, and pscost implement the callback for branching on
  relaxation candidates.
- primal heuristics may now already be called before presolving, using the new timing point
  SCIP_HEURTIMING_BEFOREPRESOL.  Note that solutions that are added before/during presolving, will be retransformed to
  the original space.
- SCIP can branch on continuous variables. The branching value x' must not be one of the bounds. Two children (x <= x',
  x >= x') will be created.

  the same scip instance, if not an error is thrown

- following methods SCIPinferVarUbProp, SCIPinferVarLbProp, SCIPinferVarLbCons, SCIPinferVarUbCons have a new 6th
  parameter "SCIP_Bool force" which allows bound tightening even if the difference to the newbound is below bound
  strengthening tolerance
- the vbc visualization adds the new bound of the branched variable to the node information
- allow user to trigger a restart during presolving SCIPrestartSolve()

- fixed bug in lp.c: SCIPlpGetUnboundedSol() did not ensure that unbounded solution lies withing the bounds of the
  variables

  will not branch but return "infeasible or unbounded" like in presolving)
- fixed bug in sepa_flowcover.c: numerical issues while computing candidate set for lambda
- fixed bug in cons_knapsack.c and sepa_clique.c: the assumption that implications are always nonredundant and contain
  only active variables is not correct anymore as the corresponing vbound might be missing because of numerics

  the performace for smaller instances, default value FALSE
- added parameter <misc/usevartable> and <misc/useconstable> which turns on/off the usage of hashtables mapping from
  variable/constraint names to the variables/constraints; when turned off, SCIPfindVar() and SCIPfindCons() may not be

  if number of rows divided by number of columns exceeds this value (default value infinity, i.e. never switch)
- added parameter <heuristics/crossover/dontwaitatroot> that allows to call crossover at root node independently from
  nwaitingnodes
- added parameter <heuristics/rens/uselprows> that allows to switch between LP row and SCIP constraints as basis for the
  subSCIP, default is TRUE (uses LP rows)

- removed two different block memories for the original and transformed problem

Makefile

- the NLP solver interfaces and expression interpreter are located in a separate library (libnlpi.*; similar to the lpi
  library) and is required to link against the SCIP library also projects that use SCIP via make/make.project need to
  change their Makefile (!!!): in the $(MAINFILE) target, add $(NLPILIBFILE) behind $(LPILIBFILE) in the dependencies
  and add $(LINKCXX_l)$(NLPILIB)$(LINKLIBSUFFIX) to the linker flags


SCIP version 1.2.0
==================

interface:
- new parameter "mksetcoefsvalid" in lp.c: SCIPlpCalcMIR(), scip.c: SCIPcalcMIR(), and sepa_cmir.c: tryDelta() to store
  whether "mksetcoefs" computed in SCIPlpCalcMIR() is valid. If the mixed knapsack constraint obtained after aggregating
  LP rows is empty or contains too many nonzero elements the generation of the c-MIR cut is aborted in SCIPlpCalcMIR()
  and mksetcoefs is not valid.
- new parameter "set" in SCIPconsSetInitial().
- new methods SCIPchgVarLbLazy() and SCIPchgVarUbLazy() in scip.h; These methods can be used to change the lazy lower or
  upper bound of a variable; This might has the consequences that the bounds of the corresponding variable is not in
  LP. This is the case if the lazy lower or upper bound is greater or less than the local lower or upper bound,
  respectively
- new method SCIPvarGetLbLazy() and SCIPvarGetUbLazy() in pub_var.h; These methods return the lazy lower or upper bound,
  respectively
- new methods SCIPgetNFixedonesSetppc() and SCIPgetNFixedzerosSetppc() in cons_setppc.{h,c}; these methods returns
  curr[5~ent (local) number of variables fixed to one/zero in the given setppc constraint
- new methods SCIPprintNodeRootPath() in scip.h This method prints all branching decisions on variables from the root to
  the given node
- new methods SCIPnodeGetParentBranchings(), SCIPnodeGetAncestorBranchings(), SCIPnodeGetAncestorBranchingPath(); These
  methods return the set of variable branchings that were performed in the parent node / all ancestor nodes to create a
  given node
- new methods SCIPgetVarConflictlengthScore(), SCIPgetVarAvgConflictlength(), SCIPgetAvgConflictlengthScore() and their
  pendants for the current run
- new method to deactivate a pricer SCIPdeactivatePricer() in scip.c
- new function SCIPsetProbName() to set problem name in scip.h/c (SCIPprobSetName() in prob.h/c)
- new parameters "lowerbound" and "result" in type_pricer.h: lowerbound can save a lower bound computed by the pricer,
  result indicates whether the pricer guarantees that there exist no more variables if no variable was found
- new methods SCIPisLPRelax() and SCIPisRootLPRelax() in scip.c and scip.h returning whether the current/root LP is a
  relaxation of the current/root problem and thus defines a valid lower bound

  different from the LP solution
- new parameter "sol" in scip.c: SCIPgetVarClosestVlb() and SCIPgetVarClosestVub() and var.c: SCIPvarGetClosestVlb() and
  SCIPvarGetClosestVub() to get closest variable bound w.r.t. sol different from LP solution

- new reader for reading and writing FlatZinc models
- new presolving step in cons_knapsack.c, same like "simplifyinequalities" in cons_linear.c
- each variable has now two additional SCIP_Real parameter which define a lazy lower and upper bound; lazy means that
  there exists constraints which implies these (lazy) bounds. If the lazy lower or upper bound is greater or less than
  the local lower or upper bound, respectively, then the corresponding bound is not put into the LP. The bounds are set
  to minus and plus infinity per default which yields the same behavior as before. With the methods SCIPchgVarLbLazy()
  and SCIPchgVarUbLazy() these bounds can be set.  This is of interest if SCIP gets used as a branch-and-price
  framework. Attention! The lazy bounds need to be valid for each feasible LP solution. If the objective function
  implies bounds on the variables for each optimal LP solution, but these bounds may be violated for arbitrary LP
  solutions, these bounds must not be declared lazy!
- added new timing point, SCIP_HEURTIMING_DURINGPRICINGLOOP, for calling heuristics; If this timing point is used the
  corresponding heuristics is called during the pricing loop of variables; we also added this timing point to
  heur_simplerounding.{h,c} which has the effect that a LP solution which satisfies all integrality conditions during
  the pricing loop is detected

- now it's possible to write strings with more than "SCIP_MAXSTRLEN" amount of characters in all message.c functions
- the current/root lp can be marked to be no relaxation of the current/root problem
- "early branching"-functionality added: in a branch-and-price code, the user can stop pricing at a node although there
  may exist variables with negative reduced costs. In this case, the lp-lowerbound will not be used. The pricer has,
  however, the option to return a lower bound.
- the infrastructure for parsing CIP format is set; each constraint handler has now an callback method
  SCIP_DECL_CONSPARSE() (see type_cons.h)
- the infrastructure for copying constraints is set; each constraint handler has now an callback method
  SCIP_DECL_CONSCOPYE() (see type_cons.h)
- all linear type constraint handlers are able to copy constraints using the function SCIPgetConsCopy() in scip.h

- improved performance in SCIPcalcCliquePartition()
- improved performance in SCIPvarGetActiveRepresentatives() in var.c

fixed bugs:
- fixed bug in SCIPlpSolveAndEval(): if fastmip and pricers enabled and objlimit was reached but CPLEX did not perform
  the final pivot step in order to exceed the objlimit, do one additional simplex step with pricing strategy steepest
  edge, if this doesn't suffice, turn off fastmip temporarily and solve again. Also consider solstat of the new
  solution.

  without bounds are binary variables, if the bound of an integer variable is infinity you have to write this bound

- limit pairwise presolving in cons_linear.c

fixed bugs:
- added handling of the case of roundable variables with 0 objective in presol_dualfix.c
- fixed handling of unbounded variables with 0 objective in SCIPlpGetModifiedPseudo[Proved]Objval() (lp.c)
- fixed CTRL-C if NO_SIGACTION is set (e.g., for MinGW)

  constraints instead of pointer copies of the consdata (as explained in the constraint handler "HowTo")
- fixed bug with reading empty lines in TSP example
- fixed bug with writing the MIP relaxation to a file concerning the objective function; in case the original objective
  function is requested, the transformed objective function gets re-transformed (scaling, offset)
- added checks whether a plugin (handler) has already been included to avoid later complications e.g. with parameters.
- fixed obvious bug in linear constraint data sorting. Most part of the code assumed pure index sorting, but in fact, it
  was sorted by variable type as first criterion and index as second criterion.

  problem!

  only work for a > 0).
- fixed bugs in second part of consdataTightenCoefs(): Removed min/maxleftactisinfinity (definition was not correct),
  fixed calculation of min/maxleftactivity, and removed asserts concerning whether all redundant vars were deleted (led
  to different behavior in debug and opt mod).
- corrected invalid memory access in tcliqueIsEdge: added check whether node1 has no neighbors (tclique_graph.c)
- fixed numerical bug in dual presolving of linear constraint handler
- fixed typo in documentation: default value for "dynamic" parameter is FALSE for all constraint handlers!

- fixed bug with uncatched LPSOLSTAT after hitting a time or iteration limit
- fixed bug with wrong update of activities in linear constraints after global upper bound changes

  presolving with hashing in cons_linear.c
- removed memory leak detected with the help of coverity in dialog.c
- fixed bug in applyFixings() in cons_varbound.c concerning tightening the bound of a variable left in a redundant
  constraint (bound change is forced now)
- fixed bug in SCIPtightenVarLb/Ub() in scip.c concering forcing a bound change (bound improvement is checked now)
- fixed bug in preprocessConstraintPairs() in cons_linear.c concerning updating the flags of the constraint that stayes

=================

compiling:
- added ncurses to the readline entries in the make/make.* files

  bounds of variables, they are not automatically be called again (it is assumed that they already made use of these
  changes). They are only called again, if they returned SCIP_SUSPENDED or if some other plugin modified the LP.
- new parameter "escapecommand" for SCIPdialoghdlrAddHistory()

  SCIPcreateConsSetcover(): usually, you should set this to FALSE; if you want to add constraints as node markers with
  node data and, e.g., use the "activate" and "deactivate" callbacks to get informed about the activation and
  deactivation of the node, you should set this flag to TRUE in order to make sure, that the constraint will always be
  associated to the node and not moved to a more global node if this would be possible
- removed method SCIPgetVarData(); use SCIPvarGetData() from pub_var.h instead
- replaced callback parameter "inlploop" and "inplunging" by "heurtiming" in SCIP_DECL_HEUREXEC
- replaced parameters "pseudonodes", "duringplunging", "duringlploop", and "afternode" by "timingmask" in
  SCIPincludeHeur() and constructor of ObjHeur() class use the following table to translate old settings into the new
  timingmask:

  value is outside of the current bounds
- new methods SCIPgetGlobalCutpool(), SCIPgetPoolCuts(), SCIPcutpoolGetCuts(), SCIPcutGetRow(), and SCIPcutGetAge()
- slightly changed semantics of SCIPaddConsNode() and SCIPaddConsLocal(), such that a constraint which is added to the
  root node now enters the global problem (and is still existing after a restart)
- new methods SCIPconsGetNLocksPos() and SCIPconsGetNLocksNeg()

plugins:
- new primal heuristic "rens"
- new primal heuristic "mutation"
- slightly modified crossover and rins heuristics
- improved presolving of and, or, and xor constraints
- improved performance of intdiving heuristic
- new primal heuristic "veclendiving"
- improved heuristic "octane"
- improved heuristic "shifting"
- slightly modified rens and localbranching heuristics
- modified guided diving heuristic such that it equals the original version of the heuristic (i.e., round in direction
  of the current incumbent solution instead of the average of all primal feasible solutions)
- modified c-MIR cut separator to more closely resemble the original version of Marchand and Wolsey
- implemented additional dual presolving in linear constraint handler
- slightly modified presolving of varbound constraint handler
- c-MIR cuts try now to scale the cut to integral values; however, cuts are still generated if this fails
- ID character for intdiving heuristic is now 'I'
- new heuristic "intshifting" (ID character 'i')

parameters:
- new parameter "reading/zplreader/changedir" to control behavior of path switching of ZIMPL file reader
- new parameter "reading/zplreader/parameters" to pass additional parameters to ZIMPL
- new parameter "propagating/abortoncutoff"
- changed default value of "heuristics/octane/usediffray" to FALSE
- new parameter "heuristics/octane/useavgwgtray"
- removed parameter "heuristics/octane/usediffbwray"
- renamed parameter "heuristics/octane/useavgray" to "heuristics/octane/useavgnbray"
- new parameter "heuristics/octane/useavgray"
- changed default value of "heuristics/rens/binarybounds" to TRUE
- changed default value of "heuristics/octane/freq" to -1 in order to deactivate Octane
- new parameter "separating/cmir/aggrtol"
- new parameter "separating/cmir/fixintegralrhs"
- new parameter "separating/cmir/densityscore"
- new parameter "separating/maxruns"
- new parameters "conflict/restartnum" and "conflict/restartfac"
- parameter "heuristics/feaspump/maxsols" is now strict, i.e., if n solutions were already found, the feasibility pump
  starts to work only if maxsols <= n, instead of maxsols < n
- new parameter "presolving/restartminred" which forbids another restart if the last one was not successful enough
- new parameter "limits/absgap" to define an absolute gap limit

features:
- primal heuristics that run before the node is solved now know already whether the LP will be solved at the current
  node or not
- command shell now understands escape characters ",', and \ which makes it possible to read in files with spaces in the
  name
- updated XPress interface to XPress-MP 17 (contributed by Michael Perregaard)
- the EXITSOL callback of the plugins is now called before the LP and the global cut pool are freed
- possibility of SAT-like restarts after a number of conflict constraints have been found
- in the root node of the very first run, heuristics with timing AFTERNODELPNODE, AFTERLPPLUNGE, AFTERPSEUDONODE, and
  AFTERPSEUDOPLUNGE are now called before the enforcement of the constraint handlers, in particular before the branching
  rules; in this way, the branching rule can already benefit from a tighter primal bound
- if a heuristic found a better solution after the LP loop (and in particular the AFTERNODE heuristics in the root node
  of the very first run, see above), domain propagation and LP solving is triggered again; this allows for additional
  reduced cost tightening and other dual propagations
- hard-coded relative objective gain to consider a separation loop to be stalling is now changed from 1e-3 to 1e-4,
  which means that separation is not aborted as early as before

fixed bugs:
- fixed bug with adding constraints with INITIAL=true and separating them afterwards, which lead to a second addition of
  the constraint's relaxation in the child node
- fixed bug in cmir cut separator, that 8*delta was not tried
- fixed bug in cmir cut separator with wrong sign of slack in row score function
- fixed bug with string pointer copy instead of string content duplication in constructors of C++ wrapper classes
- fixed bug in CPLEX interface with basis access methods that dualopt has to be called for more error status codes
- fixed bug with inserting two variable bounds of the same type on the same variable with the same bounding variable but
  with different sign of coefficient (e.g., x <= 10*z + 5 and x <= -5*z + 10); in previous version, one of the two was
  removed, although both have a useful meaning; now, we keep both, and detect a stronger global bound in the implication
  graph presolving
- fixed bug in cmir cut separator with weights fixed to zero, thus making the current aggregation invalid
- fixed bug that SCIPvarGetAvgSol() always returned the upper bound (affected guided diving heuristic)
- fixed bug in RENS, RINS, Local Branching, Crossover, and Mutation heuristics with wrong variable - subvariable
  assignments
- fixed bug in cmir cut separator with wrong calculation of cut efficacies
- objective function is now also checked for integrality after problem transformation (fixed a bug that a solution which
  was generated between transformation and presolving for an integral objective function did not reduce the cutoff bound
  by one)
- fixed a bug with cmir cut efficacy calculation (however, on my first tests, the performance reduced slightly!)
- fixed bug in infeasible/bound-exceeding LP conflict analysis if the bounds were relaxed in diving (happens in
  intshifting heuristic)
- too large deltas are now also rejected in c-MIR cut separation
- separation LPs are now immediately resolved after a bound change was generated by a cut separator; before, the
  separation round was prematurely aborted, which means that a separation round limit was sometimes reached very quickly
  and some of the separators were not even called a single time

- changed default value of branching/relpscost/cutoffweight to 0.0001
- in bfs node selector, parameter "minplungedepth" is now stronger than "maxplungedepth" if they conflict

- fixed bug with aggregating fixed variables
- fixed bugs in local branching and RINS heuristic

known bugs:
- if one uses column generation and restarts, a solution that contains variables that are only present in the
  transformed problem (i.e., variables that were generated by a pricer) is not pulled back into the original space
  correctly, since the priced variables have no original counterpart

features:
- reactivated multiaggregation in cons_linear.c on binary variables again (possible due to bug fix below)
- introduced subversion string
- adding variable bounds automatically adds the corresponding implication
- conflict clauses are now collected in a conflict store, redundant clauses are eliminated, and only the best
  "conflict/maxclauses" clauses are added permanently to the problem; the remaining clauses are only added temporarily,
  if they can be used for repropagation
- improved debugging for infeasible cuts and propagations, given a primal feasible solution
- slightly changed LP resolving loop in conflict analysis
- diving heuristics now apply propagation at each step
- if CPLEX returns that the LP exceeds the bound and if no additional LP solves are allowed in conflict analysis, we
  have to perform one additional simplex iteration to get the dual solution that actually violates the objective limit
- modified the influence of the depth level in conflict analysis

- added possibility to disable certain features by using "make USRFLAGS=-DNO_REMOVE_HISTORY", "make
  USRFLAGS=-DNO_SIGACTION", "make USRFLAGS=-DNO_RAND_R", or "make USRFLAGS=-DNO_STRTOK_R"
- linear constraint handler now catches events of variables after the problem was completely transformed in order to
  avoid the whole bunch of LOCKSCHANGED events that are generated at problem transformation stage
- added redundancy detection for pairs of constraints in setppc constraint handler

fixed bugs:
- LP primal feasibility for bounds is now defined as absolute measure (was relative to the bound before); this fixes a
  bug (see alu8_9.mps), that an LP with an integral variable fixed to a large value yields an accepted solution with
  that variable slightly different than the fixed value; the integrality feasibility condition is measured with absolute
  differences, which leads to the fixed integer variable being fractional; this leads to an error if branching is
  performed on this variable
- locally fixed variables are no longer used as branching candidates even if their LP solution value is fractional (due
  to numerical reasons, see above)
- fixed minor bugs in debug code of primal.c and sol.c
- variables that are being multiaggregated are now automatically removed from all other variables' variable bound and
  implication arrays; this fixes bugs with methods, that rely on the fact, that the entries in the variable bound and
  implication arrays are active variables only
- aggregations are now always performed in a way, such that the variable of more general type is aggregated (with type
  generality being cont > implint > int > bin); in this way, a binary variable's representant is always binary (which
  was not the case before, and resulted in a bug in SCIPgetBinvarRepresentative())
- removed wrong asserts from lpi_cpx.c
- global bound changes now lead to the removal of redundant implications (such that the asserts in sepa_implbounds.c are
  now correct)
- due to usage of variable bounds, SCIPcalcMIR() may return LOOSE variables in the cut -> modified sepa_cmir.c,
  sepa_gomory.c, and sepa_strongcg.c to use SCIPcreateEmptyRow() and SCIPaddVarsToRow() instead of SCIPcreateRow() which
  only works for COLs
- removed bug in presol_probing.c: the vars of the sorted variables array have to be captured
- fixed bug in the output of solutions with priced variables
- fixed bug in propagation with parameters prop_maxrounds and prop_maxroundsroot
- removed wrong assertion in varAddImplic()
- conflict analysis can now handle errors in LP solving calls
- fixed bug in linear constraint handler with variables fixed to infinity
- fixed bug with potential infinite loop if a separator is delayed and the LP is infeasible
- fixed numerical bug in pseudo objective propagator with only slightly tightened bounds
- fixed bug with constraint handlers that can only enforce their constraints by adding cuts, but the maximal number of
  cuts to separate is set to 0; now, cuts that are generated in the constraint enforcement are used in any case
- removed bug in SCIPvarAddVlb() and SCIPvarAddVub() with fractional vlb/vubcoefs
- removed bug that an LP might be declared to be solved even if it was marked erroneous due to numerical problems
- fixed bug with redundant self implications that wrongly lead to the detection of infeasibility
- fixed bug that primal or dual rays might not be available because the wrong solver was used
- included message.o in LPI library, s.t. one can link this library indepentent of SCIP
- fixed bug that if diving heuristic that changes the objective values finds a solution, the cutoff is reinstalled in
  the LP solver (although the objective value has no meaning due to the objective function modification)
- fixed bug in knapsack constraint presolving with tightening coefficients and capacity
- fixed bug with modifiable constraints in linear constraint handler preprocessing
- fixed bug in clique separator that reduced performance
- increased performance of clique separator by allowing only a certain number of zero-weighted fill ins
- fixed bug in linear constraint handler that global activities are not updated after global bound changes

  of locks being positive or negative
- methods SCIPvarLock(), SCIPvarLockDown(), SCIPvarLockUp(), SCIPvarLockBoth(), SCIPvarUnlock(), SCIPvarUnlockDown(),
  SCIPvarUnlockUp(), and SCIPvarUnlockBoth() are replaced by SCIPaddVarLocks() which returns a RETCODE

of SCIP, e.g. "tree.h" or "var.h".
- method SCIPreadProb() does not free the current problem - this is done in SCIPcreateProb() now, which is usually

SCIP version 0.78
=================

interface:
- new method SCIPvarIsInLP()
- new methods SCIPgetLPColumnObjval() and SCIPgetLPLooseObjval()
- new method SCIPcalcIntegralScalar() with arbitrary array of Real values
- new plugin class for relaxators (external relaxations, that can be used in parallel with LP relaxations)
- if more than one result code applies to a plugin's execution, it should return the one that is higher in the call's
  documentation list
- new method SCIPaddCoefKnapsack() in knapsack constraint handler
- removed SCIPisFeasible(); use !SCIPisFeasNegative() instead
- methods SCIPisIntegral(), SCIPisFracIntegral(), SCIPfloor(), SCIPceil(), and SCIPfrac() don't use the feasibility
  tolerance anymore (default: 1e-06); instead, they are using epsilon (default: 1e-09); instead, for handling
  integrality of a variable "in feasibility tolerances", new methods SCIPisFeasIntegral(), SCIPisFeasFracIntegral(),
  SCIPfeasFloor(), SCIPfeasCeil(), and SCIPfeasFrac() should be used
- new method SCIPisScalingIntegral() to check, whether the scaling of a value would lead to an integral value, measured
  against epsilon which is also scaled by the same scalar
- new methods SCIPgetRealarrayMinIdx(), SCIPgetRealarrayMaxIdx(), SCIPgetIntarrayMinIdx(), SCIPgetIntarrayMaxIdx(),
  SCIPgetBoolarrayMinIdx(), SCIPgetBoolarrayMaxIdx(), SCIPgetPtrarrayMinIdx(), and SCIPgetPtrarrayMaxIdx()
- new methods SCIPbsortPtrInt(), and SCIPbsortPtrIntInt()
- in LPI, the semantics of SCIPlpiHasPrimalRay() and SCIPlpiHasDualRay() changed: methods return TRUE, if a ray exists
  and the solver can return it; new methods SCIPlpiExistsPrimalRay() and SCIPlpiExistsDualRay() check whether a ray
  exists without checking, if the solver knows and can return the ray
- new method SCIPvarWasFixedAtIndex()
- new method SCIPaddConflictBd()
- even in optimized mode, the simple functions that are implemented as defines in the include files exist in the
  library, s.t. one can include the include files without NDEBUG and use the optimized library
- new method SCIPprintMemoryDiagnostic()
- new methods SCIPfindObj...() and SCIPgetObj...() in C++ wrapper interface to get the corresponding plugin object
- new branching rule plugin methods INITSOL and EXITSOL

parameters:
- slightly changed the meaning of parameter presolving/abortfac: a value of 0 now means to abort presolving only after
  no more change has been found

features:
- changed SCIProwCalcIntegralScalar() to a slightly different algorithm
- improved knapsack relaxation in linear constraint handler separator to scale the constraint in order to get integral
  coefficients instead of just rounding down all coefficients
- improved presolving of linear constraint handler: aggregation of two constraints with equal coefficient vector into
  single constraint
- improved presolving of knapsack constraint handler: aggregation of equal or negated variables in same constraint
- priority of separators, propagators, and presolvers decide whether the plugin is called before the corresponding
  constraint handler methods or after: plugins with nonnegative priorities are called before, plugins with negative
  priorities are called after the constraint handlers

fixed bugs:
- removed bug in knapsack constraint handler that appears if a variable is fixed to zero in knapsack presolving, which
  triggers a variable of the same knapsack to be fixed to one due to aggregation
- fixed bugs in consdataSwitchWatchedVars() of "or" and "and" constraint handlers
- fixed bug in all-fullstrong branching with getting strong branching information for columns not in current LP
- assigning a value to a fixed variable in a solution with SCIPsetSolVal() does not return an error anymore, if the
  value is equal to the fixed value of the variable
- implemented missing case in solve.c with branching rules that add constraints
- solving loop is now immediately aborted, if a node on the active path is marked to be cut off
- removed bug in resolving an interrupted problem, after the last solved node was cut off
- removed bug with infinite solving loop if LP solving is turned off
- removed bug in knapsack presolver
- removed bug with aborted solving in root node (e.g. due to time limit) that is tagged to be restarted
- changed numerics for integrality check of coefficients (fixed bug with accumulated errors in rows s.t. the row's
  activity is no longer integral although the row is marked being integer)
- fixed bugs in constraint handlers (and, logicor, or, setppc, xor) with calling conflict analysis during presolving
- slightly changed numerics in linear constraint handler presolving to fix a bug with coefficients detected to be scaled
  to an integral value, that are not integral after scaling due to a large scalar that increased the integrality gap to
  a value larger than epsilon
- fixed wrong assertion in xor constraint handler with switching both watched variables to unwatched
- removed bug in SCIPisScalingIntegral()
- removed bugs with calling SCIPtightenVarLb(), SCIPtightenVarUb(), SCIPinferVarLbCons(), SCIPinferVarUbCons(),
  SCIPinferVarLbProp(), and SCIPinferVarUbProp() in PROBLEM stage
- fixed bug in presolving with wrong number of newly fixed/aggregated/... variables/bounds/... after a restart


SCIP version 0.77
=================

installation:
- the file names in the archive file are now preceeded with a directory "scip-<version>/"
- the compiler is now also represented in the LP solver library names (e.g. you have to rename the softlink
  "libcplex.linux.x86.a" to "libcplex.linux.x86.gnu.a")

interface:
- added methods SCIPgetVarsLogicor() and SCIPgetNVarsLogicor() in logic or constraint handler
- methode SCIPgetGap() and SCIPgetTransGap() now return infinity, if primal and dual bound have opposite sign (this
  removes the oddness with the gap increasing while the dual bound approaches zero)

parameters:
- lp/colagelimit and lp/rowagelimit may now be set to -1 to disable deletion of columns/rows due to aging

features:
- infeasible LPs in diving now produce conflict clauses (if LP conflict analysis is enabled)
- conflict analysis was slightly modified
- slightly changed aging strategy of logic or constraint handler

fixed bugs:
- removed bug in conflict analysis that appears if the conflict is only active at the current depth level
- missing SCIPlpiIsPrimalFeasible() and SCIPlpiIsDualFeasible() implemented in lpi_spx.cpp and lpi_spx121.cpp
- removed preprocessing of linear constraint pairs with modifiable constraints
- removed wrong assert "assert(eventfilter->len == 0 || eventfilter->eventmask != 0x00000000)" from event.c
- removed wrong assert in conflict analysis (appeared on analyzing diving LP conflicts with both bounds of a non-binary
  variable changed)


SCIP version 0.76
=================

interface:
- new method SCIPchgVarBranchDirection()
- new method SCIPvarGetBranchDirection()
- new possible result code SCIP_DELAYED for primal heuristics
- changed SCIPcatchVarEvent() and SCIPdropVarEvent()
- method SCIPstage() is now called SCIPgetStage()
- method SCIPprintStatus() is now called SCIPprintStage()
- new method SCIPgetStatus() returns the solution status
- new method SCIPprintStatus() outputs the solution status (beware, that the old SCIPprintStatus() method is now called
  SCIPprintStage())

plugins:
- new method SCIPgetActivityLinear() in linear constraint handler
- new method SCIPgetFeasibilityLinear() in linear constraint handler

parameters:
- new parameter separating/efficacynorm to choose between Euclidean, maximum, sum, and discrete norm in efficacy
  calculation
- changed default frequency offset of pscostdiving (heuristics/pscostdiving/freqofs) to 2, and frequency offset of
  fracdiving (heuristics/feaspump/freqofs) to 0 in order to not call pscostdiving in root node, where nearly all pseudo
  costs are uninitialized

features:
- creation of reconvergence clauses in conflict analysis
- first node of each plunging is not treated as plunging node w.r.t. calling primal heuristics
- improved performance of logic or constraint handler due to better watched variables handling

fixed bugs:
- removed bugs in CLP Solver interface
- SCIP returned "gap limit reached" even if the problem was solved to optimality, if the optimal solution was found at a
  node with lower bound equal to the global lower bound
- after conversion of the focus node into a junction (e.g. in case of numerical troubles while solving the node's LP),
  the child nodes got the wrong LP fork attached (the common LP fork of the old and new focus node instead of the old
  focus node's LP fork)
- bug reconvergence clauses in conflict analysis if bounds on non-binary variables were the reason for the fixing of the
  uip to create a reconvergence clause for
- wrong sub calls in SCIPvarGet...CurrentRun() for aggregated variables
- variables' conflict set counter was not reset when the problem was resolved again

known bugs (still not fixed):
- unbounded models lead to an error
- air04 and air05 return wrong optimal value (1 too large): possibly due to strong branching or setppc propagation?
