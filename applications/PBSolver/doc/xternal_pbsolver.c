 *
 *  A solver for pseudoboolean problems in OPB or WBO format. It complies by default with the technical regulations of
 *  the PB competition. Therefore, the following plugins are implemented:
 *
 * - a \ref message_pb.c "message handler" to produce a valid general log with accepted line initials
 * - a \ref event_bestsol.c "event handler" to signal achievements of best primal solutions (only for optimization)
 *
 **@todo Add problem specific parameter settings.
 *
 * Installation
 * ------------
 *
 * See the @ref INSTALL_APPLICATIONS_EXAMPLES "Install file"
