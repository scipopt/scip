In the following, some of the names depend on your machine and your
compilation settings:

- $(OSTYPE):  the operating system
              the string returned by "uname -s" in lower case with the following
              replacements:
              - "cygwin*" is replaced by only "cygwin"
              - "irix??" is replaced by only "irix"
              - "windows*" is replaced by only "windows"
              - "mingw*" is replaced by only "mingw"

- $(ARCH):    the architecture
              the string returned by "uname -m", modified by the following
              rules to subsume some architectures:
               - "sun??" is replaced by "sparc"
               - "i?86", "i86pc", and "[0-9]86" are replaced by "x86"
               - "amd64" is replaced by "x86_64"
               - "IP??" is replaced by "mips"
               - "9000????" is replaced by "hppa"
               - "Power Macintosh" is replaced by "ppc"
               - "00??????????" is replaced by "pwr4"

- $(COMP):    the compiler
              "gnu", "intel", "compaq", "sun", "insure", ... (see make/ directory)

- $(OPT):     the optimization level of compilation
              "dbg", "opt", or "prf" 

- $(LPS):     the LP solver to use
              "spx", "spx132", "clp", "cpx", "xprs", "msk", "grb", "qso", "none"

- $(EXPRINT): the expressions interpreter (code that computes derivatives and hessians) to use
              "none", "cppad"

For example, if you want to install SCIP on a Linux system with a x86 processor
using the gnu compiler in debug mode, using Soplex version >= 1.4.0 as LP solver,
and no expressions interpreter you would have the following names:
- $(OSTYPE)  = linux
- $(ARCH)    = x86
- $(COMP)    = gnu
- $(OPT)     = dbg
- $(LPS)     = spx
- $(EXPRINT) = none

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is what you have to do to get SCIP running:

1. Compile the library and the solver program:
   In your SCIP main directory, enter "make [options]" with the following options:
   - "INSTALLDIR="     to current directory as install directory (dafault) 
   - "INSTALLDIR=/usr/local" 
                       to install the libraries (/usr/local/lib/) and binary (/usr/loacl/bin/) 
		       in the directory /usr/local 

   - "OPT=opt"         to use optimized compilation mode (default)
   - "OPT=dbg"         to use debug compilation mode
   - "OPT=prf"         to use performance analysis compilation mode
   - "OPT=opt-gccold"  to use optimized compilation mode and gnu gcc compiler version less than 4.2

   - "LPS=spx"         to use SOPLEX Version >= 1.4.0 as LP solver (default)
   - "LPS=spx132"      to use SOPLEX Version 1.3.2 as LP solver
   - "LPS=cpx"         to use CPLEX as LP solver
   - "LPS=xprs"        to use XPRESS as LP solver
   - "LPS=msk"         to use MOSEK as LP solver
   - "LPS=clp"         to use CLP as LP solver
   - "LPS=grb"         to use Gurobi as LP solver
   - "LPS=qso"         to use QSopt as LP solver
   - "LPS=none"        to use no LP solver

   - "COMP=gnu"        to use GNU c/c++ compiler (default)
   - other compilers are available (see make/ directory)

   - "ZLIB=true"       to use zlib and enable reading of compressed files (default)
   - "ZLIB=false"      disable zlib usage

   - "READLINE=true"   to enable readline library for interactive shell (default)
   - "READLINE=false"  to disable readline library

   - "ZIMPL=true"      to enable ZIMPL file reader (default; needs ZIMPL, ZLIB, and GMP to be installed, see 2. (g))
   - "ZIMPL=false"     to disable ZIMPL file reader

   - "GMP=true"        to use GMP library for exact counting
   - "GMP=false"       disable GMP usage; Note that GMP=false is not compatible with ZIMP=true since ZIMPL needs the GMP library 
   - "GMP=auto"        to automaticaly link the GMP library in case ZIMPL is enabled (default)
   
   - "IPOPT=true"      to enable IPOPT interface (needs IPOPT)
   - "IPOPT=false"     to disable IPOPT interface (default)
   
   - "EXPRINT=cppad"   to use CppAD as expressions interpreter
   - "EXPRINT=none"    to use no expressions interpreter (default)
 
   - "VERBOSE=false"   to suppress display of compiler and linker invocations (default)
   - "VERBOSE=true"    to display compiler and linker invocations

   On some machines, you should use gmake instead of make.

   On your first compilation you will be asked for some soft-link targets, depending on the
   LP solver you want to use. Usually, SCIP needs the following information
     (a) the directory where the include files of the LP solver
     (b) the library file(s) "lib*.a" or/and "lib*.so"
   You will need either the .a or the .so files and can skip the others by just pressing return.

   Example 1 (defaults: SoPlex, with ZIMPL support):
   =================================================

   Typing "make" uses SoPlex as LP solver and includes support for the modeling language ZIMPL.
   You will be asked the following questions on the first call to "make" (example answers are already given):

   If you ever need to modify the soft-link targets, delete the soft-links in the "lib/" subdirectory
   and enter "make links" to generate them again.

   After the soft-links have been created, the compilation of the source files should start.


   Compilation problems:
   =====================

   If the soft-link query script does not work on your machine, read step 2 for instructions on manually
   creating the soft-links.

   If you get an error message of the type
   "make: *** No rule to make target `lib/???', needed by `obj/O.linux.x86.gnu.opt/lib/scip/???.o'.  Stop."
   the corresponding soft-link was not created or points to a wrong location.
   Check the soft-link targets in the "lib/" subdirectory. Try to delete all soft-links from the "lib/" directory
   and call "make links" to generate them again. If this still fails, read step 2 for instructions on manually
   creating the soft-links.

   If you get an error message of the type
   "make: *** No rule to make target `make/make.?.?.?.?.?'.  Stop.",
   the corresponding machine dependent makefile for your architecture and compiler is missing.
   Create one of the given name in the "make/" subdirectory. You may take
   "make/make.linux.x86.gnu.opt" or any other file in the make subdirectory as example.

   The readline library seems to differ sligtly on different OS distributions. Some versions
   do not support the remove_history() call.
   In this case, you have to either add "-DNO_REMOVE_HISTORY" to the FLAGS in the
   appropriate make/make.* file, or to compile with "make USRFLAGS=-DNO_REMOVE_HISTORY".
   Make sure, the file "src/scip/dialog.c" is recompiled.
   If this doesn't work either, disable the readline library with "make READLINE=false".

   On some systems, the sigaction() method is not available.
   In this case, you have to either add "-DNO_SIGACTION" to the FLAGS in the
   appropriate make/make.* file, or to compile with "make USRFLAGS=-DNO_SIGACTION".
   Make sure, the file "src/scip/interrupt.c" is recompiled.

   On some systems, the rand_r() method is not available.
   In this case, you have to either add "-DNO_RAND_R" to the FLAGS in the
   appropriate make/make.* file, or to compile with "make USRFLAGS=-DNO_RAND_R".
   Make sure, the file "src/scip/misc.c" is recompiled.

   On some systems, the strtok_r() method is not available.
   In this case, you have to either add "-DNO_STRTOK_R" to the FLAGS in the
   appropriate make/make.* file, or to compile with "make USRFLAGS=-DNO_STRTOK_R".
   Make sure, the file "src/scip/misc.c" is recompiled.

   On some systems, the strerror_r() method is not available.
   In this case, you have to either add "-DNO_STRERROR_R" to the FLAGS in the
   appropriate make/make.* file, or to compile with "make USRFLAGS=-DNO_STRERROR_R".
   Make sure, the file "src/scip/misc.c" is recompiled.

   On some systems, the option [-e] is not available for the read command.
   You have to compile with READ=read.
   
   In some situations, it may be necessary to adjust the flags for linking against Clp.
   SCIP's Makefile assumes that Blas and Lapack are installed as system libraries (libblas.a, liblapack.a)
   and are not build into the CoinUtils library. If that is different in your build of Clp,
   you may have to remove $(LINKCXX_l)lapack$(LINKLIBSUFFIX) from the LPSLDFLAGS in Makefile
   or make.project. Also removing $(LINKCXX_l)bz2$(LINKLIBSUFFIX) may help in some cases.

   If you encounter other compiler or linker errors, you should recompile with
   "make VERBOSE=true ..." in order to get the full compiler invocation. This might help to
   fix the corresponding machine dependent makefile in the make subdirectory.


2. Instructions for manually creating the soft-links, if the query script fails:

   Create necessary soft-links in the "lib/" subdirectory of SCIP:

   (a) to use SOPLEX (Version >= 1.4.0)
       - ln -s <path to SOPLEX' *.h files> <path to SCIP>/lib/spxinc
       - ln -s <file libsoplex.[...].a> <path to SCIP>/lib/libsoplex.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).a
         for each operating system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /soplex/lib/libsoplex.linux.x86.gnu.opt.a lib/libsoplex.linux.x86.gnu.a")
         Warning! The ".opt" in the name of the SOPLEX library does not appear in the name of the soft-link.

   (b) to use SOPLEX (Version 1.3.2)
       - ln -s <path to SOPLEX' *.h files> <path to SCIP>/lib/spx132inc
       - ln -s <file libsoplex.[...].a> <path to SCIP>/lib/libsoplex132.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).a
         for each operating system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /soplex132/lib/libsoplex.linux.x86.gnu.opt.a lib/libsoplex132.linux.x86.gnu.a")
         Warning! The ".opt" in the name of the SOPLEX library does not appear in the name of the soft-link.

   (c) to use CPLEX (Version >= 10.0)
       - ln -s <path to directory of cplex.h> <path to SCIP>/lib/cpxinc
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /cplex121/include/ilcplex lib/cpxinc")
       - ln -s <file libcplex.a> <path to SCIP>/lib/libcplex.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).a
         for each operation system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /cplex121/lib/x86-64_debian4.0_4.1/static_pic/libcplex.a lib/libcplex.linux.x86.gnu.a")

   (d) to use XPRESS
       - ln -s <path to directory of xprs.h> <path to SCIP>/lib/xprsinc
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /xpressmp/include lib/xprsinc")
       - ln -s <file libxprs.a> <path to SCIP>/lib/libxprs.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).a
         for each operation system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /xpressmp/lib/libxprs.a lib/libxprs.linux.x86.gnu.a")

   (e) to use MOSEK
       - ln -s <path to directory of mosek.h> <path to SCIP>/lib/mskinc
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /mosek/4/tools/platform/linux32x86/h lib/mskinc")
       - ln -s <file libmosek.so> <path to SCIP>/lib/libmosek.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).so
         for each operation system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /mosek/4/tools/platform/linux32x86/bin/libmosek.so lib/libmosek.linux.x86.gnu.so")
       - since MOSEK is a shared library, make sure your LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains <path to SCIP>/lib

   (f) to use CLP
       - ln -s <path to CLP's and COIN's *.h files> <path to SCIP>/lib/clpinc
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /Coin-Clp/include lib/clpinc")
       - ln -s <file libClp.a> <path to SCIP>/lib/libclp.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).a
         for each operating system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /Coin-Clp/lib/libClp.a lib/libclp.linux.x86.gnu.a")
       - ln -s <file libCoinUtils.a> <path to SCIP>/lib/libcoinutils.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).a
         for each operating system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /Coin-Clp/lib/libCoinUtils.a lib/libcoinutils.linux.x86.gnu.a")

   (g) to use ZIMPL as additional file reader for reading *.zpl files
       - mkdir <path to SCIP>/lib/zimplinc
       - ln -s <path to ZIMPL's *.h files> <path to SCIP>/lib/zimplinc/zimpl
       - ln -s <file libzimpl-<version>.<options>.a> <path to SCIP>/lib/libzimpl.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).a
       Note that ZIMPL needs the GNU multiprecision library (GMP) and the Z compression library (ZLIB) to be
       installed on your system.

   (h) to use IPOPT as NLP solver
       - ln -s <path to IPOPT's header files> <path to SCIP>/lib/ipoptinc
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /Ipopt/include/coin lib/ipoptinc")
       - ln -s <file libipopt.a> <path to SCIP>/lib/libipopt.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).$(IPOPTOPT).a
         for each operating system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /Ipopt/lib/libipopt.a lib/libipopt.linux.x86.gnu.opt.a")
       - ln -s <file ipopt_addlibs_cpp.txt> <path to SCIP>/lib/ipopt_addlibs.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).$(IPOPTOPT).a
         for each operating system and architecture to use
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /Ipopt/share/doc/coin/Ipopt/ipopt_addlibs_cpp.txt lib/ipopt_addlibs.linux.x86.gnu.opt.a")

   (i) to use CppAD as expressions interpreter
       - ln -s <path to CppAD's header files> <path to SCIP>/lib/cppad
         (e.g. "cd scip; ln -s /CppAD/cppad lib/cppad")

3. To run the program enter "bin/scip.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).$(OPT).$(LPS)"
   (e.g. "bin/scip.linux.x86.gnu.opt.spx") or just "bin/scip" for the last compiled version

4. To generate the documentation, you need to have doxygen installed, and
   enter "make doc"

5. To check the code with lint, you need to have flexelint installed, and
   enter "make lint"

6. To run the MIPLIB 3 test bench, download the MIPLIB instances from
   "http://scip.zib.de/download/files/scip-miplib3.zip" and extract the archive into the SCIP base directory.
   The instances will be unziped into the subdirectory "check/IP/miplib3/". Afterwards, enter
   "make [options] test" with the same options with which you compiled SCIP in step 1.



Remarks on Installing under Windows using MinGW
-----------------------------------------------

To build your own Windows binaries under Windows, we recommend using the MinGW-Compiler with MSYS from mingw.org

First install MSYS, then MinGW to the mingw folder inside the msys folder.
Now you need to install the following packages to the mingw folder:
- zlib (or use ZLIB=false ZIMPL=false since zlib is needed for ZIMPL and ZIMPL-support in SCIP)
- pcre (or use ZIMPL=false since pcre is needed for ZIMPL and ZIMPL-support in SCIP)
- gmplib (or use ZIMPL=false since gmplib is needed for ZIMPL and ZIMPL-support in SCIP)

(After calling "make clean" in the ZIMPL folder you will also need flex and bison to remake ZIMPL.
 We recommend NOT to use "make clean" inside the ZIMPL-folder if you do not have these packages installed.)

You can download these additional packages as precompiled binaries for example from:
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html (zlib&pcre)
http://cs.nyu.edu/exact/core/gmp/ (gmplib)
or compile the source on your own from the project homepages:
http://www.zlib.net/
http://www.pcre.org/
http://www.gmplib.org/
(The command "./configure --prefix=/mingw ; make ; make install" should succeed without problems and installs the packages into the mingw folder.)

Now "make READLINE=false" should be compiling without errors.
Please note that we do NOT support creating the doxygen documentation or readline-usage under Windows.

Since there are no real symlinks in MSYS, the include and library files of SoPlex and ZIMPL are actually copied into the SCIP-lib-folder.
When you recompile ZIMPL or SoPlex after compiling SCIP you have to copy the libraries manually into the SCIP-lib-folder and recompile SCIP afterwards.
