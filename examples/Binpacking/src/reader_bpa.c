 * @brief  Binpacking problem reader file reader
 * @author Timo Berthold
 * @author Stefan Heinz
 *
 * This file implements the reader/parser used to read the binpacking input data. For more details see \ref BINPACKING_READER.
 *
 * @page BINPACKING_READER Parsing the input format and creating the problem
 *
 * In the <code>data</code> directory you find a few data files which contain each one binpacking problem. These data
 * files have the following structure. In the first line the name of the instance is stated. In the second line you find
 * three integer numbers. The first one gives you the capacity \f$\kappa\f$, the second the number of items, and the
 * last integer states the value of a known feasible solution. This means an upper bound on the number of needed
 * bins. The remaining lines give the size for each item.
 *
 * For parsing that data, we implemented a reader plugin for \SCIP. A reader has several callback methods and at least
 * one interface methods (the one including the reader into \SCIP). For our purpose we only implemented the \ref
 * READERREAD "READERREAD" callback and the interface method which adds the reader plugin to \SCIP.
 *
 * @section BINPACKING_READERINCLUDE The SCIPincludeReaderBpa() interface method
 *
 * The interface method <code>SCIPincludeReaderBpa()</code> is called to add the reader plugin to \SCIP (see
 * cmain.c). This means \SCIP gets informed that this reader is available for reading input files. Therefore, the
 * function <code>SCIPincludeReader()</code> is called within this method which passes all necessary information of the
 * reader to SCIP. This information includes the name of the reader, a description, and the file extension for which the
 * file reader is in charge. In our case we selected the file extension "bpa". This means that all files which have
 * this file extension are passed to our reader for parsing. Besides these information the call
 * <code>SCIPincludeReader()</code> also passes for each callback of the reader a function pointers
 * (some of them might be NULL pointers). These function
 * pointers are used by \SCIP to run the reader. For more information about all available reader callbacks we refer to
 * the \ref READER "How to add file readers" tutorial. In the remaining section
 * we restrict ourself to the callback <code>READERREAD</code> which is the only one we implemented for the binpacking
 * example. All other callbacks are not required for this example.
 *
 * @section BINPACKING_READERREAD The READERREAD callback method
 *
 * The READERREAD callback is in charge of parsing a file and creating the problem. To see the list of arguments this
 * functions gets see the file type_reader.h in the source of \SCIP. The following arguments are of interest in our
 * case. First of all the \SCIP pointer, the file name, and the SCIP_RESULT pointer. The \SCIP pointer gives us the
 * current environment. The file name states the file which we should open and parse. Last but not least, the SCIP_RESULT
 * pointer is required to tell \SCIP if the parsing process was successfully or
 * not. Note that in type_reader.h you also find a list of allowable result values for the SCIP_RESULT pointer and the
 * <code>SCIP_RETCODE</code> which is the return value of this function.
 *
 * @subsection BINPACKING_PARSING Parsing the problem
 *
 * The file can be opened and parsed with your favorite methods. In this case we are using the functionality provided by
 * \SCIP since this has some nice side effects. We are using the function SCIPfopen() which can besides standard
 * files also handle files which are packed. To find all files related to the parsing of a file, we refer to the file pub_misc.h
 * in the source of SCIP. Parsing the data out of the file is not that hard. Please look at the code and comments
 * therein for more details.
 *
 * @subsection BINPACKING_CREATING Creating the problem
 *
 * After parsing the file the final task for the reader is to create the problem. In our case, we pass the collected data
 * to the \ref probdata_binpacking.h "main problem data plugin". For this, we use the interface methods
 * SCIPprobdataCreate() which is provided by the
 * problem data plugin (see probdata_binpacking.c). After that, the reader sets the result value for the SCIP_RESULT
 * pointer to <code>SCIP_SUCCESS</code> and returns with a proper <code>SCIP_RETCODE</code>.
