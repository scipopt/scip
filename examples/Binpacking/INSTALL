In the following, some of the names depend on your machine and your
compilation settings:

- $(OSTYPE): the operating system
             the string returned by "uname -s" in lower case with the following
             replacements:
             - "cygwin*" is replaced by only "cygwin"
             - "irix??" is replaced by only "irix"
             - "windows*" is replaced by only "windows"

- $(ARCH):   the architecture
             the string returned by "uname -m", modified by the following
             rules to subsume some architectures:
              - "sun??" is replaced by "sparc"
              - "i?86" is replaced by "x86"
              - "IP??" is replaced by "mips"
              - "9000????" is replaced by "hppa"
              - "Power Macintosh" is replaced by "ppc"
              - "00??????????" is replaced by "pwr4"

- $(COMP):   the compiler
             "gnu", "intel", "compaq", "sun", "insure", ... (see make/ directory)

- $(OPT):    the optimization level of compilation
             "dbg", "opt", or "prf"

- $(LPS):    the LP solver to use
             "spx", "spx132", "clp", "cpx", "xprs", "msk"

For example, if you want to install SCIP on a Linux system with a x86 processor
using the gnu compiler in debug mode, and using Soplex version >= 1.4.0
as LP solver, you would have the following names:
- $(OSTYPE) = linux
- $(ARCH)   = x86
- $(COMP)   = gnu
- $(OPT)    = dbg
- $(LPS)    = spx

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is what you have to do to get the binpacking example project
using SCIP as a library running:

1. Install and compile SCIP as described in the INSTALL file of SCIP's main 
   directory, and make sure to create the necessary softlinks in SCIP's lib 
   directory

2. In the directory Binpacking edit the variable SCIPDIR if necessary - it should
   point to the directory that contains SCIP.

3. Compile the binpacking example project:
   In the main directory Binpacking, enter "make OPT=<...> LPS=<...> COMP=<...>"
   with the following options:
   - "OPT=opt"       to use optimized compilation mode (default)
   - "OPT=dbg"       to use debug compilation mode
   - "OPT=prf"       to use performance analysis compilation mode
   - "LPS=spx"         to use SOPLEX Version >= 1.4.0 as LP solver (default)
   - "LPS=cpx"         to use CPLEX as LP solver
   - "LPS=xprs"        to use XPRESS as LP solver
   - "LPS=msk"         to use MOSEK as LP solver
   - "LPS=clp"         to use CLP as LP solver
   - "COMP=gnu"      to use GNU c/c++ compiler (default)
   - other compilers are available (see make/ directory)

4. To run the program enter "bin/binpacking.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).$(OPT).$(LPS)"
   (e.g. "bin/binpacking.linux.x86.gnu.opt.spx") or "bin/binpacking" which is a link
   to last compiled version

5. To generate the documentation, you need to have doxygen installed, and
   enter "make doc"

On some machines, you should use gmake instead of make.
