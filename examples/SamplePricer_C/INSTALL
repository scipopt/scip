In the following, some of the names depend on your machine and your
compilation settings:

- $(OSTYPE): the operating system
             the string returned by "uname -s" in lower case

- $(ARCH):   the architecture
             the string returned by "uname -m", modified by the following
             rules to subsume some architectures:
              - "sun??" is replaced by "sparc"
              - "i?86" is replaced by "x86"
              - "IP??" is replaced by "mips"
              - "9000????" is replaced by "hppa"
              - "Power Macintosh" is replaced by "ppc"
              - "00??????????" is replaced by "pwr4"

- $(COMP):   the compiler
             "gnu", "intel", "compaq", "sun", "insure", ... (see make/ directory)

- $(OPT):    the optimization level of compilation
             "dbg", "opt", or "prf"

- $(LPS):    the LP solver to use
             "spx", "spx121", "clp", "cpx"

For example, if you want to compile the SamplePricer example on a Linux system with a x86 processor
using the gnu compiler in debug mode, and using Soplex version >= 1.3.0
as LP solver, you would have the following names:
- $(OSTYPE) = linux
- $(ARCH)   = x86
- $(COMP)   = gnu
- $(OPT)    = dbg
- $(LPS)    = spx

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is what you have to do to get the C example project using SCIP as a library
running:

1. Install and compile SCIP as described in the INSTALL file of SCIP's main 
   directory, and make sure to create the necessary softlinks in SCIP's lib 
   directory

2. In the directory SamplePRicer_C edit the variable SCIPDIR if necessary - it should
   point to the directory that contains SCIP.

3. Compile the example project:
   In the example's main directory, enter "make OPT=<...> LPS=<...> COMP=<...>"
   with the following options:
   - "OPT=opt"       to use optimized compilation mode (default)
   - "OPT=dbg"       to use debug compilation mode
   - "OPT=prf"       to use performance analysis compilation mode
   - "LPS=spx"       to use SOPLEX Version >= 1.3.0 as LP solver (default)
   - "LPS=spx121"    to use SOPLEX Version <= 1.2.1 as LP solver
   - "LPS=cpx"       to use CPLEX as LP solver
   - "LPS=clp"       to use CLP as LP solver
   - "COMP=gnu"      to use GNU c/c++ compiler (default)
   - other compilers are available (see make/ directory)

4. To run the program enter "bin/pmedian.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).$(OPT).$(LPS)"
   (e.g. "bin/pmedian.linux.x86.gnu.opt.spx")

5. To generate the documentation, you need to have doxygen installed, and
   enter "make doc"

6. To check the code with lint, you need to have flexelint installed, and
   enter "make lint"

On some machines, you should use gmake instead of make.
