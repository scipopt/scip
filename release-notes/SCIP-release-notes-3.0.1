Notes for SCIP Release 3.0.1


Interfaces
==========

- new method SCIPgetNLimSolsFound() to get number of solutions that
  respect the objective limit

- when using an objective limit, heuristic characters are not
  displayed any longer for worse solutions


Features
========

- added delayed cutpool which only gets separated if the sepastore is
  empty after a separation round


Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- better handling of generalized (Lagrangian) variable bounds

- fixed several issues in cumulative constraint handler

- fixed bug which caused deletion of ranged rows parallel to objective

- fixed several numeric issues

- fixed bug with LP not being flushed after bound changes on columns
  that are not in the LPI

- fixed inconsistent behavior of methods
  SCIPlpiIs{PrimalFeasible,DualFeasible,Optimal,...}

- many small bug fixes, see CHANGELOG
