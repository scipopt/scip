Interfaces
==========

- changed parameter <propagating/pseudoobj/maxcands> to
  <propagating/pseudoobj/minuseless> (see prop_pseudoobj.c) due to revision
  of the pseudo objective propagator

- added parameter <heuristics/undercover/fixingorder>

Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- revised pseudo objective propagator 

- improvements in undercover heuristic

- fixed numeric issue in aggregations

- fixed compilation issues with negate() function in intervalarith.c on
  exotic platforms

- fixed handling of unbounded solutions, including double-checking their
  feasibility and that the primal ray is a valid unboundedness proof and
  reoptimizing the LP with modified settings if the solution is not
  feasible
